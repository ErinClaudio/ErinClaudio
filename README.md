### Hello, I'm [Erin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-claudio/), 

An experienced Developer with experience at [Planet Argon](https://www.planetargon.com/), where I played a crucial role in delivering diverse projects using Ruby on Rails and React. My work included:

  * Improving the maintainability of 5+ production applications.
  * Completing a long-term refactor from a deprecated framework to React for a major shoe brand.

Additionally, I've contributed to open-source projects such as [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/), where I focused on Test-Driven Development (TDD). My experience with Ruby for Good has allowed me to acquire insight into new programming languages, tools, and technologies, enhancing my development skill set. I'm eager to explore how my skills and experience align with your needs.
